# Honeypot-Based Attacker Behavior Analysis (Planning Phase)

This repository documents the planning and learning phase for a future security project focused on honeypot-based attacker behavior analysis.

No honeypot deployment or data collection has been performed yet.

## Problem Statement
Internet-facing systems are continuously targeted by automated and manual attacks. Honeypots provide a controlled way to observe attacker techniques without exposing production systems.

## Proposed Scope
- Study Linux-based honeypots and safe deployment practices
- Understand attacker behavior through logged interactions
- Plan basic log analysis using Python
- Explore automation ideas for identifying suspicious activity

## Tools and Concepts to Explore
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Python scripting
- System and authentication logs
- Basic security automation concepts

## Current Status
- [x] Research and planning
- [ ] Environment setup
- [ ] Honeypot deployment
- [ ] Log analysis
- [ ] Automation experiments

## Note
This repository currently contains documentation and planning material only. No live honeypot is running at this stage.
